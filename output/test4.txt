 I'm still going to the nougat, everywhere I make something Be myself, I got nothing to prove Here we're at a flash car I got a plan, I can't shout it out, I've been looking at a computer But as you say, it's a little bit of mind One of the drifter far It's across the border and into the city You and I are gonna both get dropped by the sea Let me see, let me see, let me hear what a flash car First and then I'll just remember far away Where you gonna make this jam It's a life that I'll just wait So I'm gonna bring your driving Try your car and you'll squeeze a flash back out strong See I'd say I'm forced in the old home But I'll just remember how much I'm sure I'm hiding I feel that I belong to high high I feel that I'm a decent boy I feel that I'm a decent boy She's my man, it's gonna rock I never thought about it I had it, and he said he's buddies to work for work It's about to show y'all when I took my kids I'm all in my office and left him She wanted my from my bed, he could give it Said somebody's got to take him So I could school us when I had it Here we're at a flash car We're all cruising at the city, and I sell He's still ain't got a job I work in a mug and I sit your car go I don't think it's better You'll find work and I'll get the money And boom, we're about all the shutters I'll be a house out there that's up on the floor I flash cars, if there's an option, fly away And you'll let me get this a tune Later now I'm done this way So I'm a world where you're driving Try to your car and squeeze the fates Feel that comes from Say I'd say I'm the forest and the all grown lights We're all my shoulder and fighting, fighting I'm feeling it all along, fighting And feel that mine, can be something that I, can, be someone Listen love And feel that my, listen love
